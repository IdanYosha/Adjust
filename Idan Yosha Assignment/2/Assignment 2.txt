2.Imagine a server with the following specs:
- 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
- 64GB of ram
- 2 tb HDD disk space
- 2 x 10Gbit/s nics
The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per second.
Please let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific case and how would you do that? What are the challenges of monitoring this?

Answer:

The metrics that are interestin are the 2 10Gb nics , i whould monitor thos nics via WireShark. 
I whould do it with taking a switch and connecting the 2 10Gb nics to it, and making a port forwording to 2 diffrent ports on the switch.
The big chalange is to get the SSL traffic decrepted and i whould to it whith putting a SSL TAP decryptor after the switch.
p.s
You can also use VLAN's in the switch in case you have more traffic coming into it.

The rest of the server specs i whould monitor via a 3rd party program like "Prometheus" to make sure the CPU HDD and memory are not overload.
